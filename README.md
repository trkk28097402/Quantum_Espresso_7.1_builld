# QE 7.1
First time in HPC competition!
Participating ISC online with only two month experience in hpc...

## 1. Intro
### Quantum Espresso 
An integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale.
It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.
#### cp.x
A core component of the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution.
CP can perform Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics, including variable-cell dynamics
#### pw.x
A set of programs for electronic structure calculations within density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory, using plane wave basis sets and pseudopotentials.

## 2. Environment
On FAU cluster with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8360Y CPU @ 2.40GHz CPU

## 3. Compiler
Intel2021 with IntelMPI

## 4. Run
